    "The syntax supports three operator symbols characterizing relationships between variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `~` to specify the structural part                -> the regression operator\n",
    "- `=~` to specify the measurement part              -> for latent variable definition\n",
    "- `~~` to specify common variance between variables\n",
